Bot was created basing on steam verion of the game, pixels are hard coded, values i used:

* Single player
* Desktop resolution: 1920x1080
* Game resolution: 640x480 windowed, right in the centre of screen(as it opens)

Bot works best on the cookie background and that cyberpunk vaporwave one, sometimes on normal trees it randomly hits wrong button

Highest score i managed to get with this bot is 6284
