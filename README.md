# Timberman-bot
I wanted to make a quick and fun side project whilst working on my Engineering Thesis

# Settings
Bot was created basing on steam verion of the game, pixels are hard coded, values i used:
* Single player
* Desktop resolution: 1920x1080
* Game resolution: 640x480 windowed, right in the centre of screen(as it opens)

# How to run the bot:
Download and run the script in any IDE of your choice, you might need to install pyautogui, `pip install pyautogui`, then start the game, focus on Timberman window and look how it gets the score for you

Bot works best on the cookie background and that cyberpunk vaporwave one, sometimes on normal trees it randomly hits wrong button

Highest score i managed to get with this bot is 6284
